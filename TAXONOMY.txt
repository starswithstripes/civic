taxonomy
------------------------------------------

About: Until there is a stable faux taxonomy export module
to make taxonomies exportable, use the standard values
below across installations of Civic (formerly called Owh).

Note: This practice began around features-6.x-1.0-beta6. 
The current 6.x-1.0 release does have stable faux taxonomy 
exportables, but no migration path to D7. Since we've waited this 
long, we might as well wait a little longer. If migrating 
what we've got to D7 is easier, 6.x versions of Civic may never 
put taxonomy into features. (BH 3/3/11)
